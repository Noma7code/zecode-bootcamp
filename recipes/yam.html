    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Kontomire stew is a very popular staple dish in Ghana. It is traditionally
      made with cocoyam leaves (called kontomire leaves) but can easily be made
      with frozen or fresh spinach.
    </p>
    <p>
      This stew can be made vegan, but is traditionally seasoned with a variety
      of dried, canned, fresh, and even cured/fermented fish. Ampesi is just the
      name of boiled plantain and yam. Since it is made with a ton of greens,
      this dish is packed with nutrients and can be modified to suit different
      tastes.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 bunches 600 g. spinach, fresh or frozen</li>
      <li>2-3 large tomatoes diced</li>
      <li>1 habanero pepper or more to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 inch piece of ginger</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>1/2 large or 1 medium onion, sliced</li>
      <li>1 tbsp. smoked shrimp powder optional</li>
      <li>1/2 cup egusi ground melon seeds</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp. salt or to taste</li>
      <li>Boiled yam or plantain (green or ripe), or rice</li>
      <li>Boiled egg</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons to 1/2 cup vegetable oil or palm oil</li>
      <li>Sliced avocado</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Place ginger, garlic, and habanero in a blender. Add up to 1/4 cup of
        water to help blend. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        If using fresh spinach, remove stems from spinach and roughly chop.
      </li>
      <li>
        In your Perfect Pot, heat vegetable oil and add sliced onions. Saute
        onions for about 3 minutes until they soften and start to brown
        slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add parsley, bouillon cube, smoked paprika, shrimp powder, and momoni
        (fermented fish) to the oil and saute until fragrant, about 3 minutes.
        Momoni may break up in oil, so remove any bones if using. Keep stirring
        to prevent burning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add blended ginger, garlic, and habanero mixture to the oil and saute
        briefly, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add diced tomatoes, breaking them up with the back of your Beechwood
        Spatula. Bring to a light boil, then reduce to a simmer. Stir
        occasionally to prevent burning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simmer uncovered until the stew thickens and some water evaporates,
        about 10-15 minutes. Remove cover, and stir egusi into stew. Cover again
        and simmer for 5-7 minutes without stirring.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add spinach and cover. The spinach should wilt after about 3 minutes.
        When wilted, stir spinach into tomato stew until incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add canned mackerel. Do not add tomato sauce from canned fish to your
        stew, as it changes the flavor of the stew. I also remove the soft bone
        in the middle of the mackerel but this can be left in, as it is soft and
        is not a choking hazard.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently break up mackerel but keep the chunks fairly big. Simmer for 5-10
        more minutes uncovered.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve hot with a side of boiled yam, boiled rice, or boiled plantain, an
        egg, and sliced avocado.
      </li>
    </ol>
